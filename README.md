In this project I am trying to write my own QR code generator:

## TODO:
- [ ] Incorporate automated testing in the project
- [ ] Incorporate automated PEP 8 enforcement (pylint)
- [ ] Learn how the QR codes are created
- [ ] Write the logic for creating QR codes (MVP) and display them in the console
- [ ] Prepare a GUI (web / desktop)
